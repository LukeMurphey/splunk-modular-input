This library is no longer used within the modular input library. The original [ipaddress module](https://github.com/google/ipaddr-py/tree/master) is deprecated in favor of the [ipaddress module in Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html). I'm keeping this library around for now because some apps may still use it within their code.
