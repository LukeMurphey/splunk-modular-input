"""
This module includes a series of libraries that are useful for allowing modular inputs to work on
Univeral Forwarder instances that don't include the Python interpeter and thus don't have access
to Splunk's libraries.

The functions provided will default to using the Splunk function if available. Otherwise, the
built-in function will be used.
